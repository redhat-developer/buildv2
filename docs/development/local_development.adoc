= Running on development mode

The following document highlights how to deploy a Build controller locally for running on development mode.

*Before generating an instance of the Build controller, ensure the following:*

* Target your Kubernetes cluster. We recommend the usage of KinD for development, which you can launch via our link:/hack/install-kind.sh[install-kind.sh] script.
* On the cluster, ensure the Tekton controllers are running. You can use our Tekton installation script in link:/hack/install-tekton.sh[install-tekton.sh]

'''

Once the code have been modified, you can generate an instance of the Build controller running locally to validate your changes. For running the Build controller locally via the `local` target:

[,sh]
----
pushd $GOPATH/src/github.com/shipwright-io/build
  make local
popd
----

NOTE: The above target will uninstall/install all related CRDs and start an instance of the controller. All existing CRDs instances will be deleted.
