# Running the Controller

Assuming you are logged in to an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster, run

```sh
make clean build local
```

If the `pipeline` service account isn't already created, here are the steps to create the same:

```sh
oc create serviceaccount pipeline
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z pipeline
```

If your `Build`'s `outputImage` is to be pushed to the OpenShift internal registry, ensure the
`pipeline` service account has the required role:

```sh
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor -z pipeline
```

Or

```sh
oc policy add-role-to-user  system:image-builder -z pipeline
```

In the near future, the above would be setup by the controller.

## Building it locally

```sh
make clean && make build
```

* This project uses Golang 1.16+ and controller-gen v0.5.0.
* The controllers create/watch Tekton objects.

## Building in container image

The `shipwright-builder-image` container image is provided with the required tools to build the 
`Build` project. The image can be built and used to build or run any make target using the following 
command:

```sh
make container-image
make container-make TARGET=ginkgo
```

* `docker` is used as the default container engine. `podman` can be used by prepending 
`CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` before  `make` commands.

# Testing
